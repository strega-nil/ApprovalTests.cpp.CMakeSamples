| Directory    | [conan_cmake](/conan_cmake/)                                 |
| Purpose      | Demo how to build your tests using Conan's `cmake`  generator to download single headers for specific releases of ApprovalTests.cpp and Catch2.<br />The released headers of those dependencies will be downloaded inside your CMake build space, and will not be shown inside your IDE. |
| Dependencies | ApprovalTests.cpp - downloaded automatically by Conan<br/>Catch2 - downloaded automatically by Conan |
| Mechanism    | Uses Conan's [`cmake`](https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/integrations/build_system/cmake/cmake_generator.html) generator.                              |
